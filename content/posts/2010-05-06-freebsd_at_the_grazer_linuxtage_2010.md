For the first time ever FreeBSD had a booth on the [Grazer Linuxtage](http://www.linuxtage.at/) this year. That was primarily the fault of [Daniel Seuffert](http://www.bsdgroup.de/) who agreed to pack all his material and drive to Graz to represent BSD with his own booth. Sure I couldn't let him do this alone so I agreed to help and also [sperber](http://blog.frozen-zone.org/) and [seppo](http://bsdev.at/) helped us through the day. And I think we did quite well for the first time and also agreed to be there next year. 
The event is mainly targeted at end users and enthusiastic open source users. So we were quite surprised about the interest in BSD given that this was the first year that we were there. It was also very pleasant to see all different kinds of people together and many women interested in beastie.
