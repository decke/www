About a year ago i've started thinking about how to implement Request Based Priority Queues in Helma and got to the conclusion that Jetty 5.1 which Helma uses up to now is too old for what i wanted to do so i've created a patch for Helma to use a newer Jetty but had never time to finish it. 
Today i've read about hannes wishlist for Helma 1.7 and time seemed perfect to talk with him about my patch. About 10 Hours later i've succeeded and can serve at least the _welcome_ app.
